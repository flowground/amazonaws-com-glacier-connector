    "description": "Amazon Glacier is a storage solution for \"cold data.\"\n\nAmazon Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides secure,\ndurable, and easy-to-use storage for data backup and archival. With Amazon\nGlacier, customers can store their data cost effectively for months, years, or\ndecades. Amazon Glacier also enables customers to offload the administrative\nburdens of operating and scaling storage to AWS, so they don't have to worry\nabout capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data replication, hardware\nfailure and recovery, or time-consuming hardware migrations.\n\nAmazon Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost is paramount and\nyour data is rarely retrieved. If your application requires fast or frequent\naccess to your data, consider using Amazon S3. For more information, see Amazon\nSimple Storage Service (Amazon S3) [http://aws.amazon.com/s3/].\n\nYou can store any kind of data in any format. There is no maximum limit on the\ntotal amount of data you can store in Amazon Glacier.\n\nIf you are a first-time user of Amazon Glacier, we recommend that you begin by\nreading the following sections in the Amazon Glacier Developer Guide:\n\n *   What is Amazon Glacier\n   [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html] -\n   This section of the Developer Guide describes the underlying data model, the\n   operations it supports, and the AWS SDKs that you can use to interact with\n   the service.\n   \n   \n *   Getting Started with Amazon Glacier\n   [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/amazon-glacier-getting-started.html] \n   - The Getting Started section walks you through the process of creating a\n   vault, uploading archives, creating jobs to download archives, retrieving the\n   job output, and deleting archives.",
